# MindMirror

MindMirror is an innovative application designed to provide real-time feedback and insights on a user's thoughts and speech patterns. Leveraging the power of Google Gemini's multi-agent, multimodel capabilities, MindMirror processes audio input, converts it to text, analyzes the content using AI, and provides spoken feedback to the user. The user interface is dynamically generated based on the AI's assessment of optimal presentation.

## Technology Stack

*   **Frontend:** Next.js (for a dynamic and server-rendered React application)
*   **Backend:** Firebase with Python Functions (for scalable and serverless backend logic)
*   **AI/NLP:** Google Gemini SDK (for speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and multi-agent analysis)
*   **Database:** Firebase Realtime Database or Firestore (for storing user data and settings)

## Features

*   **Real-time Audio Processing:** Captures user audio input in real-time.
*   **Speech-to-Text:** Converts spoken language into text using Gemini's speech-to-text capabilities.
*   **AI-Powered Analysis:** Utilizes Gemini's multi-agent and multimodel features to analyze text content for patterns, sentiment, or other desired insights.
*   **Text-to-Speech Feedback:** Provides spoken feedback to the user based on the AI's analysis.
*   **Dynamic UI Generation:** The user interface is generated and adapted by the AI based on the perceived needs and optimal presentation for the user's current interaction.

## Setup and Running

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js and npm or yarn installed
*   Python installed
*   Firebase CLI installed
*   Google Cloud project with the Gemini API enabled

### Frontend Setup

1.  Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
2.  Install dependencies:
    
```
bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    
```
3.  Configure Firebase SDK in your Next.js application (refer to Firebase documentation for details on integrating with web projects).
4.  Set up environment variables for Firebase configuration (e.g., API key, auth domain, etc.).

### Backend Setup

1.  Navigate to the `backend` directory (or the directory containing your Firebase Functions).
2.  Install Python dependencies:
    
```
bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
```
3.  Set up Firebase Functions (refer to Firebase documentation for initializing Functions and linking to your Firebase project).
4.  Configure access to the Google Gemini API within your Python functions (using service accounts or other authentication methods).
5.  Deploy your Firebase Functions:
```
bash
    firebase deploy --only functions
    
```
### Running the Application

1.  Start the frontend development server from the `frontend` directory:
```
bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    
```
2.  Ensure your Firebase Functions are deployed and accessible.
3.  Access the application in your web browser (usually `http://localhost:3000`).

### Configuration

*   **Firebase Configuration:** Update the Firebase configuration in your frontend and backend code with your project's details.
*   **Gemini API Configuration:** Ensure your Firebase Functions have the necessary credentials and permissions to access the Google Gemini API.
*   **AI Logic:** Customize the AI analysis logic within your Firebase Functions to perform the desired text analysis and generate the appropriate text-to-speech responses.
*   **Dynamic UI Logic:** Implement the logic in your frontend (potentially guided by backend AI responses) to dynamically generate the user interface.
